1. Create Maven Project
2. Add basic spring boot dependencies
    1. spring-boot-starter-parent
    2. spring-boot-starter-web
3. Default this application is running on tomcat server  on port 8080
4. Basic annotations used in this app
    1. @SpringBootApplication
    2. @RestController
    3. @RequestMapping
    4. @GetMapping
    5. @PathVariable
5. Make sure controller class and it's package should be inside the base package which is ord.example
6. Here We developed two end points or apis
    1. http://localhost:8080/v1/greetAll
    2. http://localhost:8080/v1/greetUser/Ajay
7. When we develop first API we tested by starting/running Main class
8. When we develop second API, we stopped and re ran Main class. Every time when we make code changes we have to stop and run the server agian.
9. If we use eclipse by default it will not terminate the previous application instance so we will get port already in use error.
10. If we use IntelliJ we will have an option Rerun the Main class so this will stop and re-run the application.
11. We used POSTMAN tool to test these two APIs.
